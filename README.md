WinPaths
========

Mac OSX services for working with Windows SMB share paths

This creates 2 services, one that opens a file using its Windows path, and one that copies the Windows path of a selected file to the clipboard.

To install, simply drag the application to either /Library/Services or ~/Library/Services
